Set up the database and table with the necessary fields (id, name, description, price, and quantity).

Create a database.php file to handle the database connection and common functions using MySQL.

Include the database.php file in other PHP files to access the database connection and CRUD functions.

In create.php, handle the form submission to add a new product using "addProductToDatabase()" and redirect back to the product list page.

In update.php, handle the form submission to update a product using "updateProductInDatabase()" and redirect back to the product list page.
